# Joseph Land

A 2D portfolio that is also a game. What happens when you give a determined person WiFi and no adult supervision? You get this. Explore boldly. If you are a hirer, end his unemployment arc. (That last part is not a joke. Please hire him.)

WASD or click/tap to move. Turn on volume for better immersion. Or leave it off and live in silence. Your call.

## How to run

You need Node.js and npm. Then:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the URL it prints. Try not to get lost.

## How to build

```bash
npm run build

A `dist` folder will appear. You did not hallucinate it.

```bash
npm run preview

## Who and what you will find

### On the island (outside)

- **The slime** – Your first encounter. It will tell you what Joseph Land is. It is also a slime. We could not find a better sprite. It works.
- **Wenzheng** – Grand Master (Managing Director) of the Data Guild. Thinks Joseph’s SQL is enchanted steel. Once tried to stump him; Joseph replied with a dashboard.
- **Janet** – Keeper (Executive Director) of the Data Guild. Signs scrolls while Joseph conquers chaos. Will tell you to hire him before another kingdom does.
- **Evan** – Vice President, Joseph’s direct boss. Mission: impossible timeline. Outcome: completed early. Enemy: legacy system. Result: restructured. Conclusion: Joseph needs larger quests, not more supervision.
- **Chest 1 and Chest 2** – Wooden. Locked. Very mysterious. We are not telling you what is inside.

### Inside the house (the room)

- **Dad** – Joseph’s father. Types very fast. If you hire Joseph, you are also stabilizing Dad’s retirement portfolio. He has made this clear.
- **Mom** – Made Joseph from scratch. She fed him properly. She has already told all the aunties he is successful. Your move.
- **Kiki** – A dog. Small but emotionally powerful. Joseph buys the treats. If he does not get hired, treat budget drops. Kiki will stare at you through the screen.
- **Moca** – Another dog. Cute. This is non-negotiable. Joseph funds the snack lifestyle. No hire means possible downgrade to regular kibble. Think carefully.
- **Ceyline** – Joseph’s rich Indochinese girlfriend. If you do not hire him, he will be forced to live off her very large trust fund. Villas. Yachts. Mild inconvenience. She would prefer him ambitious, not lounging. So would he, probably.

### Things you can click on (room)

- **Computer** – Joseph’s PC. Other devs know some languages; he claims to know them all. The receipts are on his GitHub.
- **TV** – He watches tech YouTubers. The usual suspects. You can ask the TV.
- **Fridge** – Leftovers from 2019. A carrot that might be from The Last of Us. Milk with a name and a lawyer. He is not touching any of it.
- **Diploma** – Master’s in CS from UPenn. Somehow a guy who once struggled with printer drivers made it to the Ivy League. Please clap quietly.
- **Game console** – Valorant. He instalocks duelist and will not apologise. Favourite game: Suikoden II. If you have not played it, he says you cannot be friends. (You can. But play it.)
- **Coffee machine** – Or a printer. Depends who is asking.
- **Shelves** – Books. He likes to stand in front of them and pretend he knows how to read.
- **Resume** – On the desk. Achievements so dense they slightly bend reality. Link inside. Open before he adds “World Domination (In Progress)” to Experience.
- **Drawers** – Clothes and random cables. Classic.
