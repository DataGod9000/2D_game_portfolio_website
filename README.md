# ✨ Tic Tac Toe

A little terminal Tic Tac Toe game for two players — play with a friend! 🎮

```
  a  b  c
  d  e  f
  g  h  i
```

Type a letter (**a**–**i**) to place your X or O. That's it!

---

## 🚀 Quick start

1. **Run the game**
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

2. **Take turns**  
   When it's your turn, type one letter (a–i) and press Enter. Empty cells show their letter; taken cells show X or O.

3. **Win (or draw)**  
   Get three in a row (across, down, or diagonal) to win. If the board fills up with no winner, it's a draw!
